# SDL-Pong

**SDL-Pong** is a modern recreation of the iconic 1970s Pong game, written in C using SDL2. This project is designed as a learning tool to grasp the basics of programming and game development.

## 🎮 About the Project

The goal of **SDL-Pong** is to create a faithful remake of the original Pong while incorporating modern development practices. The game features simple mechanics: two paddles, a bouncing ball, and a competitive score system. It’s a fun way to dive into game programming, graphics rendering, collision detection, and event handling.

### 🛠️ Features
- **Classic Pong Gameplay**: Feel the nostalgia with the original mechanics!
- **Smooth Graphics**: Rendered using SDL2 for simple yet effective 2D visuals.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Player 1 and Player 2 each control their paddles using keyboard inputs.
- **Scorekeeping**: Competitive fun with a score tracker for both players.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **SDL2**: Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is required for rendering and event handling. You can install it on most platforms:

```bash
# For Linux
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

# For macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install sdl2

Installation

Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SDL-Pong.git
cd SDL-Pong

Compile the project:

bash

./build.sh 

Run the game:

bash

./SDL-Pong

🎮 How to Play

    Player 1 uses the W and S keys to move the paddle up and down.
    Player 2 uses the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys to move their paddle.
    The game starts automatically; the ball bounces between the paddles, and players try to score by getting the ball past their opponent.
